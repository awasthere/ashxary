      Dear Rashmeet,<br><br>
      First thing first why do I always come back? 
Ans. Just told me one thing ki ghr kamjor ho jaye to uski renovation krate hai jab colours fade out ho jaye to new paint krdete hai ghr to change ni krte na similarly It's far far far far far far better to come back  instead of choosing someone else again to start a new cycle again with them and fall into the same trap. I think it's better to take time and again come back to the same person and persuade her/him. Dusri chiz jb tm gusse me itna kch hmko boli wo pkad ke baithe rhne se bdhia acche time me jitna accha kch boli wo pakad ke baith te syd wo relation bachale ...I know those instagram shits show ki ooo let her/him go do this do that tons of thoughts and opinions. Trust me all are bullshit and at the end it's maturity to realise that no one is perfect no one. Though there are cases. If I'm not important to you anymore just because of someone else's opinion or you have forgotten all the good deeds I did to you, how we had started in the beginning, then please no need to comeback. But if you still remember me, still remember how we started, how everything matched, how we used to fix everything, then you are most welcome. I think right now I'm mature enough to understand that obviously I or you will  get far better than you or me who will understand me/you the way I/you want to but what at what cost...Aashi shuru shuru me dusro ki problem smjhna bht aasani parta jab apni khd ki problem aati hai to koi ni smjhna or smjhana chahta. Unse baat krenge unke bare me janenge sab accha chlega fir unke sth bigda shuru hoga fir dono koi aone apne ego oe ayenge aur wo relation bhi khtm...You asked me na ki tmne mujhse kab hurt kia tmne mujhe bht baar hurt kia hai bht baar agr hurt ni hota to birthday wale din apne rota ni nevertheless I chose you over all my frustrations ego anger aur aisa nhi hai ki I never thought to leave you mere man me bhi bht baar aaya but I was knowing leaving is never a option. I know my worth, I know what I'm capable of, I do understand how human mind works. If you have perceived something negative about someone doesn't matter ki wo insan kitna bhi accha ho wo tmhare lie khrb hi hoga kyuki tm apne mund me waisa bnaye rkhi ho...tmne bhi bht kch gusse me mujhe aisa bola hai agr wo mai bola hota to tm syd or jyda gussa krti...meri ek hi trauma thi past ki sab chor ke chle jate hai tmne bhi to whi kia chor k chli gyi na....and mujhe ni pta tmhe kisne kya patti pdha do hai jo bhi pdhayi bht hi glt pdhayi kyuki ek tym tha jb tm chor ke jane se drti thi and ye ek time jo tmhare lie bht asan hai krna...

Dekho ek chiz agr tm utna smjhdaar ho to smjho ki hr kisi ke life me ek lowest phase ata hai ek kisi ke I think mere life me bhi aya. Jab lowest phase ata hai to logo ke andar insecurity, anger, fear aur bhi negative thoughts aajata hai jiske karan wo insan sirf gltiyo pe gltiya kare jataa hai every time. Jaise hum kiee. I won't say I am properly okay or whatever but Still learning many things trying to control my mind my expectations from everything. I don't know why but tmhare exams ke baad tm bht badli hui thi like choti choti baato ko glt perceive krlena jaise ki rude wali baatien  and then snapchat delete krke nya bnanana everything and all you were not okay I guess kch chiz thi jo tm hmse hide kr rhi thi but it's okay. Tm bhi presaan thi kisi chiz se syd mere se hi ya kisi or chiz se you were also at your lowest kyuki I know jb tm khus rhti ho to how you behave and all. Mere sth bhi aisa hota hai when I'm positive I try to make everyone feel calm peaceful and happy but meri hi mental state bigdi hui ho jaise phle hogyii thi to hum sab khrb kr deta hai...upar se ye instagram ke reels.....but I know jisse jab khrb ho jaye tut jaye to usse fir se bnaya bhi jata haii obviously we can't continue our old chapter but we can start our new chapter which I personally want to keep superÂ private...
