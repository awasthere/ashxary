      Dear Rashmeet,<br><br>
      It's been more than 5 month since we haven't spoken to each other. I thought when your anger will fade, you would unblock me. When I started talking to you from very first day I was very sure to keep you just because this time I wasn't wanted to lose someone again. I know we have been arguing and have been toxic a lot, both of us. There haven't been a single day when I haven't thought about our friendship. I know you, I know you far better than anyone else could. There is something which always pulling me back, Idk. Look I won't play any game or tell lie ki haa mujhe to kch frq hi ni praa ya I didn't miss you. I missed you every single day but I thought this time it's better to not contact u until I saw you day before yesterday. I missed you even when i have many people to talk with either male/female friend, they do appreciate me, they do care about me, they do guide me but still there was something missing and it was you. I don't care whether you do care about me or not but deep inside I have still the urge to guide you, to scold you, to love you, to do care for you, to not hurt you intentionally. Yes you told me you are stuck with me, I will kidnap you and words hold no value in this generation but there's me who told you I'll always be loyal to you, never leave you alone, when everyone will be against you or hate you or mistreat you, i will always be there with you and here I am even after not talking to you still didn't gave anyone your place or talked with anyone like I used to talk with you. Even after having so much intense fights between us, having these feelings inside me for you has let me know yess the connection from my side is real. Yrr dekh I know I have hurt you but tune bhi kia hai yr but still i don't want to blame you. kyuki agr samne wala glt tha to hum kn sa sahi behave krdie I should have control on my self too. In this past 5 months I have reflected on my self very much, my negative side and my positive side both. I won't say ki I have completely changed my negative side but still I'm working hard on that part of me. yr let's fix everything again. Dekh tujhe agr manana rhta to mai phle hi kch krke mnaa leta and you know that very well but nhi is baar i wanted to self reflect on myself to make sure if I will be back to you i don't repeat same mistake again. I will try my best to not let you hurt again. tumne mujhpe jitna trust kia hai i know utna kisi pe ni kia hai, please do that again and we both know if we connected this time it's gonna forever. Let's fix our friendship.. looking forward to connect with you again.
